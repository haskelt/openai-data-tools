In the case of Likert scale questions, the respondents are typically asked to indicate their level of agreement or disagreement with a statement using options such as \"strongly disagree,\" \"disagree,\" \"neutral,\" \"agree,\" and \"strongly agree.\" These options can be ranked in a logical order, but the difference between each option is not necessarily equal or measurable.\n",
